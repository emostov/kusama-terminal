## Background

The aim of this project was to learn about Polkadot, Substrate, and the role of Kusama in devloping Polkadot. I find Polkadot exciting because its approach to chain interopability seems to have potential for broadening the practical use of blockchain, and reducing bounds of scalability found in other projects.

My journey for this project brought me to participate in Parities Riot chat rooms, read through depths of Parities and Web3foundations documentation, and scouring the quickly evolving codebases of Substrate (Rust) and Polkadot.js (TypeScript). While not reflected directly in the scripts for this project, I was able to significantly further my understanding of Polkadot's NPoS protocol and their various solutions on chain interopability.

Much of the challenges from this project where due to the quickly evolving nature of the Kusama and the gaps in documentation and just minimal resources in general compared to the ecosystems surrounding more matured blockchain protocols. So, while the 

At the time of writing Polkadot has yet to go public with their mainnet.
